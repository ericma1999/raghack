The flat has a large bedroom, with a super king bed and blackout blinds; a living room with lovely views; a fully-equipped kitchen & bathroom; and lots of storage space. A fibre optic cable is installed for very fast broadband. The bedroom is very quiet, not adjoining any other property. The flat is one of seven one-bed flats in a private block, and is on the third floor (no lift). It is central and has great transport links (including the Elizabeth line, via nearby Farringdon). The flat would be suitable for a professional individual or couple, or for a student in post-graduate education.The flat was occupied for years by my sister and has since had three sets of very nice tenants. It has always been kept in excellent working order, and we have just had it freshly repainted (since these photos were taken, but with the same colour scheme). I am hoping to find someone who likes to live somewhere nice, and will be keen to keep it that way. To help make this happen, I am happy to offer to pay myself for a thorough cleaning of the flat once a month.So that you know... the main disadvantages we have found to living in the flat were: no residents' parking; no easy bicycle storage (though you are welcome to carefully carry bikes upstairs and keep in the flat); living room can get hot in summer (the velux windows have a shade-screen option that helps a lot with this); and the bedroom window has a not-especially-lovely view of the office building behind, and is somewhat overlooked by the office workers during the day when they are there. But truly, as a whole it is a great place to live in a wonderful area, and my sister, previous tenants and myself have all been very happy there."

Council tax and ultilities are the responsibiity of the tenant(s).  Maximum occupancy of 2 people (this propertly is not licensed as a house in multiple occupation (HMO)).12 months minimum tenancy length.Testimonial from a previous tenant:  “This flat is lovely and it was a delight to call it home for the largest part of my 3-year expat period in London. Not only was there an immediate connection with the flat, but I could also count on Amanda's kindness and support throughout the tenancy. The spec including two bathrooms and location were perfect for me, within walking distance of idyllic Angel to the north and cool Shoreditch to the south, and for someone who works in the City of London there are options between a very short bike ride or even walking. Gainsborough Studios is an efficient purpose-build structure, and insulation makes energy costs very reasonable. Also worth noting that having the support of the porters from the West block was also quite convenient, especially for parcels or deliveries but also to find a parking space in the building and others. I can recommend this flat without hesitating, it would be a privilege to live here longer if I was to stay in London”."
